Devbox Provisioning for Vagrant (CentOS 7.x)
---------------------------------------------

The scripts herein are used by Vagrant to prepare an environment for development 
in my various projects or projects that I am a part of.

Each script will perform a particular action (typically, that's an installation
of some sort).

You can find a working example of their usage in the [c2cs-jsdoc](https://github.com/c2cs/c2cs-jsdoc) project.
